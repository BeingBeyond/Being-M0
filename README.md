We introduce MotionBase, the first large-scale motion generation benchmark containing over one million motions with detailed textual descriptions, significantly advancing the capability to effectively train motion generation models. More Visualization can be found on our [[Website]](https://beingbeyond.github.io/motionbase-0).



## Code
We will release our code and part of our dataset soon.
