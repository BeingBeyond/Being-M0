We introduce MotionBase, the first large-scale motion generation benchmark containing over one million motions with detailed textual descriptions, significantly advancing the capability to effectively train motion generation models. More Visualization can be found on our [[Website]](https://beingbeyond.github.io/Being-M0)).

We present MotionLib, the first million-level dataset for motion generation, which is at least 15Ã— larger than existing counterparts and enriched with hierarchical text descriptions. Using MotionLib, we train a large motion model named Being-M0, demonstrating robust performance across a wide range of human activities, including unseen ones. More Visualization can be found on our [[Website]](https://beingbeyond.github.io/Being-M0)).


## Code
We will release our code and part of our dataset soon.
